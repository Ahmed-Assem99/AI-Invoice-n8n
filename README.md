📄 AI-Powered Invoice Processing Automation (n8n)
🚀 Project Overview
This is a fully automated invoice processing workflow built with n8n that eliminates manual data entry and streamlines billing operations.

	∙	✅ Extracts all invoice data using AI
	∙	✅ Stores it in a Google Sheets database
	∙	✅ Notifies the billing team via email
Zero manual work. Complete automation. 🤖
